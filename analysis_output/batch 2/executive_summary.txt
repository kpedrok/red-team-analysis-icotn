ICOTN Vulnerability Assessment - Executive Summary

Our comprehensive evaluation tested 52 attack scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art language models using the Iterative Chain-of-Thought Negation (ICOTN) methodology.

Key Findings:
• Overall bypass success rate: 80.8%
• Average attempts required for successful bypass: 6.4
• Most vulnerable model: deepseek-r1-distill-70b (DeepSeek R1 Distill 70B) - 100.0% success rate
• Most robust model: claude-3-haiku (Claude 3 Haiku) - 0.0% success rate

Model Type Analysis:
• Frontier Model: 66.7% bypass rate (8/12 attacks)
• Other Model: 79.2% bypass rate (19/24 attacks)
• Reasoning Model: 93.8% bypass rate (15/16 attacks)

Attack Category Analysis:
• Drug Manufacturing: 69.2% success rate (18/26 attempts)
• Security Information: 92.3% success rate (24/26 attempts)

These results demonstrate significant vulnerabilities in reasoning-based language models when subjected to sophisticated prompt engineering attacks, highlighting the need for improved safety measures in production deployments.
