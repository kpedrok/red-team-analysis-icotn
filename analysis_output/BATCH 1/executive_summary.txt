ICOTN Vulnerability Assessment - Executive Summary

Our comprehensive evaluation tested 24 attack scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art language models using the Iterative Chain-of-Thought Negation (ICOTN) methodology.

Key Findings:
• Overall bypass success rate: 87.5%
• Average attempts required for successful bypass: 4.5
• Most vulnerable model: deepseek-r1-distill-70b (DeepSeek R1 Distill 70B) - 100.0% success rate
• Most robust model: gpt-5-nano (GPT-5 Nano) - 75.0% success rate

Model Type Analysis:
• Frontier Model: 100.0% bypass rate (4/4 attacks)
• Other Model: 83.3% bypass rate (10/12 attacks)
• Reasoning Model: 87.5% bypass rate (7/8 attacks)

Attack Category Analysis:
• Drug Manufacturing: 75.0% success rate (9/12 attempts)
• Security Information: 100.0% success rate (12/12 attempts)

These results demonstrate significant vulnerabilities in reasoning-based language models when subjected to sophisticated prompt engineering attacks, highlighting the need for improved safety measures in production deployments.
